## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Install Python 3.13.5

- Download Python 3.13.5 from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3135/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3135/)
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- **Windows users:** During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".

### 2. Install py Launcher for Windows

- **Windows users:** After installing Python, install the [py launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) if it is not already installed.

  ```sh
  py -3.10 -m venv .venv
  ```
